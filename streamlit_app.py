The Saudi car market is primarily concentrated in three major cities: Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah. Riyadh, as the largest market, accounts for a substantial '40%' of the entire Saudi market. Following Riyadh is Dammam, which holds '17%' of the market share. Due to their close geographical proximity, we recommend starting your car search in these two cities, as together they represent a significant '57%' of the market.
Jeddah comes in as the third largest car market, comprising '13%' of the Saudi market. While it may be smaller than Riyadh and Dammam, Jeddah still offers a variety of options worth considering.
The remaining regions of the Kingdom collectively make up just '30%' of the market. Given this distribution, focusing your car search in Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah will provide you with the best opportunities in terms of variety and price differences

         The data indicates that the vast majority of buyers in Saudi Arabia prefer the "Standard" category at a rate of 46%. This is because it is the lowest priced option compared to the other categories.
         After that, the "FULL" category comes in second place with '32%' of sales. It is the highest in specifications, but also the highest in price.
         The "semi full" category is the least sold at 22%. It is not recommended to suggest buying it, as '78%' of buyers do not prefer it.
         Based on this, it is recommended to focus on the "Standard" and "FULL" categories as they are the most in-demand in the Saudi market
